            <p>
                Your privacy is important to us. That is why our policy is
                simple and to the point:

            <h2>1. No Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                We do not track what you do on our site. We don&apos;t use
                Google Analytics, Facebook Likes, or any other third-party
                software that tracks and analyzes your behaviour. Nor do we use
                any tracking tools developed by us. We do not need to know who
                you are, where you&apos;re from, and how exactly you use our
                site. None of our business.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Minimal Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                We use ONE (1) cookie to ensure that this site works as
                intended. When you log in, we place a cookie in your browser.
                This cookie contains one piece of information: your user ID,
                i.e. the unique number under which your account is listed in our
                database. This piece of information makes sure that you and only
                you see all your projects and tasks. The user Id is encrypted to
                make sure that only our servers can access this information.
                This is the only cookie we need. Deleting this cookie means
                logging you out.

            <h2>3. Data Stored In The EU</h2>
            <p>
                This site is hosted by Heroku, a subsidiary of US-based
                Salesforce.com. When setting up our hosting we chose the option
                to host our site in the EU. We expect Heroku to follow EU
                privacy regulations. Should we ever find out that they are in
                breach of such regulations we will move this site to a different
                hosting provider.

                problem. Just log in, go to &quot;My Account&quot; and click on
